We see Ads everytime when we use social media. Companies spend so much money these on digital platforms to promote their products to customer.

At real time, business may consider different complex to predict whether a user would click Ad or not or maybe purchase their product .

These analysis requires Customer Analysis which can be done using:

Customer Demographic which includes Age, income, salary, gender

Geographical data which includes country,city, State these customers live in

Customer browsing history with their past purchases.

So much data to look into? Right!

As a beginner, you might want to start with something easy but also something which has impact as a real use case .

I have uploaded this simple dataset over kaggle to practise using customer demographic. You can use these demographics to predict whether a customer would purchase the product after click or not.

You can use any classification ML algorithm to perform this task : Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN or Random Forest
